DiscImageChef physical device support is currently under development so this section is incomplete and subject to change.

DiscImageChef currently supports ATA, ATAPI, SCSI, USB Mass Storage, USB Attached SCSI and FireWire SBP2 device.

Support should be the same on Windows and Linux, however Windows is absolutely untested and may simply crash or generate a blue screen of death.
